### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Jasmine, software developer since 2019


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Redmind as a Fullstack developer

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a few different projects, both at work but also on my free time,
- On a professional level
    * Learning more about NextJS
- In my free time 
    * Refreshing my Python knowledge
    * Building a fullstack app called SLAPI (SL-API),
      taking on endpoints from TrafikLab for a user to 
      be able to get themselves around Stockholm, in a 
      better way than today

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any fun projects you have going on

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about React Native as that's where I usually spend my time

- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to work as an urban planner before
